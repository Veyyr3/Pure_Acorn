# How Acorn works

## The Acorn Architecture

<img src="/DOCS/imgs/how_it_works/zone_location.png" title="" alt="" data-align="center">

**The Acorn Architecture** consists of hierarchy: **functions** are the minimum units. **Location** is the container of functions. **Zone** is the container of Locations. In timeline functions execute by order.

**In code:** Zone, Locations are vectors. Yes, it's simple.

In **REACORN-way** developers use indices to access the context to change functions order. So, developer should create protection to check array boundaries.

Also in **REACORN-way** functions execute vice versa (to protect 101 error in runtime).

**Here an example of Acorn function (REACORN-way):**

```rust
fn name(world: &mut World, context: &mut AcornContext) {
    // your_logic
}
```

World to change data. Context to change functions or global states.

## The Acorn Pipeline

In acorn_setup developer create intial Zones, Locations, Functions. Main function use data from acorn_setup and execute acorn_loop.

## The Light Acorn Loop

<img src="/DOCS/imgs/how_it_works/how_to_use.png" title="" alt="" data-align="center">

**Light Acorn Loop** based on **Macroquad async function**. Developer uses in the Light Acorn API 2 zones: **before** and **after** turning on 2d render. Zone is container of own developer's locations. Location is container of own developer's functions. 

**Function should be AcornFunction** but it **can contents anything**: Macroquad functions, bevy_ecs Queries, function of other library or custom function of developer. Of course, developer can add own Zones (see in other doc).

**Actually Light Acorn is Macroquad with architecture.**

**Features:** Developer can change function's order in locations. Developer can change location's order in zones. Developer can change order of zones. In ACORN-way developer can't reorder functions in runtime. In REACORN-way developer can reorder functions in runtime.

## The Acorn ECS

<img src="/DOCS/imgs/how_it_works/acorn_ecs.png" title="" alt="" data-align="center">

#### **All functions are time-markers.**

All functions can change data only through ECS-window.

Acorn ECS based on Bevy ECS. Actually ECS here is data base. 

**ECS-Queries are here like SQL-Queries in SQLite.**

**Close-rooms architecture:** They don't know about each other, don't know who changed data because they aren't linked by data.

**In Acorn in one moment executing only 1 function**. 

All functions go by order but nobody can't stop developer: **you can use several parallel ECS-Queries in 1 function**. After this, function ended and acorn loop goes on.

**Here is an example ECS-function:**

```rust
fn acorn_example_update_oaks(world: &mut World, _context: &mut AcornContext) {
    // create query
    let mut query = world.query::<&mut Oaks>();

    // cycle for all entities. 
    // Spoiler: game will be over when oaks reach 18 446 744 073 709 551 615 :)
    for mut oaks in query.iter_mut(world) {
        oaks.x += 1; 
    }
}
```

## What are ACORN-way and REACORN-way?

**It's simple:**

- **ACORN-way:** you can't reorder functions in runtime. But you are absolutely sure that functions will execute by your order.

- **REACORN-way:** you can reorder funtions in runtime. But **you should be disciplined** to avoid 101 erorrs in runtime. And so... next I offer to you new architecture: Lord-Minor.

## The Lord-Minor Architecture

<img src="/DOCS/imgs/how_it_works/lord_minor.png" title="" alt="" data-align="center">

**It is only for REACORN-way.** It is feudalism of functions to protect discipline.

**Lord-Location:** here are **Lord-Functions** which can change other functions order in **Minor-Locations**.

**For each Lord-Functions in Lord-Location you should create own Minor-Location.**

**Minor-Location:** here are functions which obey to Lord-Function. They listen him and die, move or born by his orders.

**Example:** if there are 3 Lord-Functions in Lord-Location then 3 Minor-Locations for each Lord-Functions.

**OR Just Memorise:** ***One Lord-Function = One his Minor-Location.***

**But YOU are not required to use this architecture. You are Lord of your ideas.**
